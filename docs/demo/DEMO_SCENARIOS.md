## Demo Talking Points by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Patient Scheduling (Slide 3)

**Context:** Front desk receives a call from Sarah Williams requesting a telehealth appointment.

**Talk Track:**
> "Sarah Williams is an established patient with diabetes. She's calling to schedule a virtual visit because she's experiencing some dizziness. Let me show you how quick and easy this is in AureonCare.
>
> [SEARCH] I type her name, and instantly, her record appears—complete with her medical history, active medications, and insurance information.
>
> [SCHEDULE] I select 'Schedule Appointment,' choose 'Telehealth Consultation,' pick Dr. Anderson, and find an available slot in 2 days at 10 AM.
>
> [CONFIRM] With one click, the appointment is booked. Sarah receives an automated confirmation via email with a link to join the video call. No phone tag, no manual reminders."

### Scenario 2: Clinical Encounter (Slide 4)

**Context:** Dr. Anderson opens Sarah's chart before the telehealth visit.

**Talk Track:**
> "Before the visit, Dr. Anderson reviews Sarah's chart. Here's the power of a unified patient record.
>
> [HISTORY] He can see her complete medical history:
> - Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 1 year ago
> - Hypertension for 2 years
> - Allergic to Penicillin—flagged prominently for safety
> - Currently on Metformin with good compliance
>
> [TIMELINE] The patient timeline shows her journey—every visit, every lab result, every prescription—all in one place.
>
> This context is critical. Dr. Anderson knows exactly where Sarah has been and where she needs to go."

### Scenario 3: Telehealth Session (Slide 5)

**Context:** Dr. Anderson starts the telehealth session with Sarah.

**Talk Track:**
> "It's 10 AM. Dr. Anderson clicks 'Start Session.' AureonCare instantly creates a Zoom meeting and sends Sarah a join link via SMS.
>
> [VIDEO] Within seconds, they're face-to-face virtually. Sarah explains her dizziness symptoms.
>
> [DOCUMENTATION] While listening, Dr. Anderson documents the encounter in real-time—SOAP notes, vitals from Sarah's home BP monitor, her glucose log.
>
> [PRESCRIBE] Based on the conversation, he prescribes Lisinopril for better blood pressure control.
>
> [TRANSMIT] With one click, the prescription is sent electronically to CVS Pharmacy via Surescripts. Sarah will get a text notification when it's ready—usually within 20 minutes.
>
> Same quality of care as an in-person visit. Same documentation. Same billing. But Sarah didn't have to take time off work or commute to the clinic."

### Scenario 4: Lab Orders (Slide 6)

**Context:** Dr. Anderson orders a lipid panel for Sarah.

**Talk Track:**
> "During the visit, Dr. Anderson notices Sarah is overdue for a lipid panel—common for diabetic patients.
>
> [ORDER] He orders the test right here in the encounter. He selects 'Lipid Panel,' chooses Labcorp, links it to her diabetes diagnosis for proper coding, and submits.
>
> [TRANSMIT] AureonCare sends a FHIR ServiceRequest to Labcorp electronically. Sarah receives instructions to visit any Labcorp location for a fasting blood draw.
>
> [TRACKING] The lab order gets a tracking number—LAB-123456. The system monitors it in real-time:
> - Order created
> - Sent to Labcorp
> - Specimen received
> - Results pending
>
> [RESULTS] When results arrive, they'll flow back into Sarah's chart automatically. If any values are abnormal, they'll be flagged in red for Dr. Anderson to review.
>
> No faxing. No phone calls. No lost results."

### Scenario 5: Revenue Cycle Management (Slide 7)

**Context:** Behind the scenes, AureonCare automatically generates a claim for Sarah's visit.

**Talk Track:**
> "Here's where AureonCare eliminates administrative burden.
>
> [AUTO-CAPTURE] The moment Dr. Anderson saved Sarah's encounter, the system automatically:
> - Captured the diagnosis codes (E11.9 for diabetes, I10 for hypertension)
> - Assigned the procedure code (99214 for an established patient visit)
> - Generated a claim form
>
> [ELIGIBILITY] Before submitting, AureonCare verified Sarah's insurance eligibility with Blue Cross Blue Shield. Her coverage is active, and her $30 co-pay is noted.
>
> [SUBMIT] The billing team clicks 'Submit to Clearinghouse.' The claim is transmitted to Optum, which routes it to Blue Cross.
>
> [TRACKING] The claim gets a tracking number and appears on the RCM dashboard. Billing staff can monitor its status:
> - Submitted: Day 1
> - Acknowledged by payer: Day 2
> - Processed: Day 15
> - Payment posted: Day 30
>
> [METRICS] The dashboard shows real-time metrics:
> - Total claims submitted this month
> - Approval rate
> - Denial rate—we're at 4.2%, half the industry average
> - Cash flow visibility
>
> This visibility transforms revenue cycle management from reactive to proactive."

### Scenario 6: Integration & Interoperability (Slide 8)

**Context:** All of Sarah's data flows seamlessly across systems via FHIR.

**Talk Track:**
> "Let's talk about what's happening behind the scenes.
>
> [FHIR] Every data point in Sarah's record is stored in FHIR R4 format—the global standard for healthcare data exchange.
>
> [PRESCRIPTION] When Dr. Anderson prescribed Lisinopril:
> - AureonCare created a FHIR MedicationRequest resource
> - Transmitted it to Surescripts using national standards
> - Surescripts routed it to CVS Pharmacy
> - CVS confirmed receipt and filled the prescription
> - Status updates flowed back to AureonCare in real-time
>
> [LAB ORDER] When Dr. Anderson ordered the lipid panel:
> - AureonCare created a FHIR ServiceRequest resource
> - Sent it to Labcorp via their API
> - Labcorp acknowledged the order
> - When results are ready, they'll come back as FHIR Observation resources
>
> [HIE] If your organization participates in a Health Information Exchange, Sarah's data can be shared with:
> - Hospitals (if she's admitted)
> - Specialists (if she needs a referral)
> - Other providers in the care network
>
> All using standard FHIR APIs—no custom integrations needed."

### Scenario 7: Analytics & Reporting (Slide 9)

**Context:** Leadership reviews performance metrics for the month.

**Talk Track:**
> "Let's step back and look at the big picture.
>
> [CLINICAL DASHBOARD] The clinical team sees:
> - Total diabetic patients: 487
> - Patients with recent HbA1c testing: 87% (target: 90%)
> - Hypertension control rate: 78%
>
> This data supports quality improvement initiatives and value-based care contracts.
>
> [OPERATIONS DASHBOARD] Practice managers see:
> - Appointments scheduled this week: 342
> - No-show rate: 3.5%—far below industry average thanks to automated reminders
> - Provider utilization: 82%—we're efficiently using our capacity
> - Average wait time: 12 minutes—patients are happy
>
> [FINANCIAL DASHBOARD] The CFO sees:
> - Month-to-date revenue: $245,890
> - Claims pending: 69 (we know exactly what's in the pipeline)
> - Denial rate: 4.2%—excellent performance
> - Revenue by payer—which contracts are most profitable
>
