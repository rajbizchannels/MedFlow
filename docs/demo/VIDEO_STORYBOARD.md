> "Healthcare doesn't exist in a vacuum. Your systems need to communicate with each other and with external partners.
>
> This is MedFlow's Integration Hub. We're already integrated with Labcorp for lab orders, Surescripts for ePrescribing to 95% of US pharmacies, Optum for claim submission to hundreds of payers, and Zoom for telehealth.
>
> Everything runs on FHIR R4—the global standard for healthcare data exchange. Every patient record, prescription, lab order is stored in FHIR-compliant format.
>
> What does this mean? MedFlow can exchange data with virtually any modern healthcare system—EHRs, labs, pharmacies, health information exchanges. For larger health systems, MedFlow connects to HIEs using standard FHIR APIs.
>
> The key insight: MedFlow fits into your existing ecosystem rather than replacing everything."

**Action Sequence:**

   - Authorization (RBAC)
   - Data Protection
   - Audit & Compliance
   - Scalability & Deployment
2. (Optional: Show brief glimpse of user management screen with roles)

**Audio/Voiceover:**
> "Security and compliance aren't afterthoughts—they're built into every layer.
>
> MedFlow uses role-based access control. Every user has a specific role—Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Patient—with granular permissions. A receptionist can schedule appointments but cannot access clinical documentation.
>
> All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Every action is logged—who accessed what patient record, when, and from where. This supports HIPAA compliance and security investigations.
>
> MedFlow is HIPAA and GDPR ready with Business Associate Agreements available. You can deploy in the cloud or on-premises, and the platform scales from 5-person clinics to 500-provider health systems."
