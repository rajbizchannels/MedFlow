Can add new diagnosis on-the-fly\n\n**Searching for Diagnoses:**\n\n**ICD-10 Code Search:**\nMultiple search methods:\n\n**By Description:**\n• Type: \"diabetes\"\n• Shows all diabetes-related codes:\n  - E11.9 - Type 2 Diabetes without complications\n  - E11.65 - Type 2 Diabetes with hyperglycemia\n  - E10.9 - Type 1 Diabetes\n  - E11.22 - Type 2 Diabetes with chronic kidney disease\n\n**By ICD-10 Code:**\n• Type: \"E11.9\"\n• Direct match displayed\n• Related codes suggested\n\n**By Body System:**\n• Browse categories:\n  - Endocrine (E codes)\n  - Circulatory (I codes)\n  - Respiratory (J codes)\n  - Digestive (K codes)\n  - Musculoskeletal (M codes)\n\n**Smart Search Features:**\n• Autocomplete as you type\n• Shows code + description\n• Recently used codes at top\n• Favorite/common codes saved\n• Synonym recognition (\"sugar diabetes\" = diabetes mellitus)\n\n**Diagnosis Details:**\n\n**Required Fields:**\n• ICD-10 Code (e.g., E11.9)\n• Description (auto-filled from code)\n• Date of Onset\n• Status (Active, Chronic, Resolved)\n\n**Optional Fields:**\n• Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe)\n• Laterality (Left, Right, Bilateral) - if applicable\n• Stage/Grade (for cancers, ulcers, etc.)\n• Clinical Notes\n• Treating Provider\n• Date Resolved (if applicable)\n\n**Status Types:**\n\n**Active:**\nCurrently being treated\n• Shows in active problem list\n• Included in encounter documentation\n• Available for linking to orders/prescriptions\n\n**Chronic:**\nOngoing, long-term condition\n• Subset of Active\n• Flagged for special tracking\n• Requires regular monitoring\n• Examples: Diabetes, Hypertension, Asthma\n\n**Resolved:**\nNo longer active\n• Moves to past medical history\n• Not in active problem list\n• Available for reference\n• Date resolved documented\n\n**Rule Out:**\nDifferential diagnosis, not confirmed\n• Appears with \"R/O\" prefix\n• Used during workup\n• Update to Active or Remove after testing\n\n**Linking Diagnoses:**\n\n**Link to Prescriptions:**\n\nWhen prescribing medication:\n1. ePrescribe Step 4\n2. Select primary diagnosis for prescription\n3. Improves claim approval\n4. Documents medical necessity\n\n**Example:**\nPrescribing Metformin → Link to E11.9 (Type 2 Diabetes)\n\n**Link to Lab Orders:**\n\nWhen ordering labs:\n1. Step 1: Clinical Indication required\n2. Select diagnosis from problem list\n3. Links order to condition\n4. Supports medical necessity\n\n**Example:**\nOrdering A1C → Link to E11.9 (Type 2 Diabetes)\n\n**Link to Procedures:**\n\nFor procedures and billing:\n1. Procedure requires diagnosis pointer\n2. Select applicable diagnosis(es)\n3. Up to 12 diagnoses per claim\n4. Primary diagnosis listed first\n\n**Link to Encounters:**\n\nIn clinical note:\n1. Assessment section lists diagnoses\n2. Mark primary diagnosis for visit\n3. Links to E&M code for billing\n4. Supports level of service billed\n\n**Managing Existing Diagnoses:**\n\n**Editing:**\n1. Click diagnosis in problem list\n2. Click 'Edit'\n3. Update fields:\n   • Change status\n   • Update severity\n   • Add notes\n   • Modify date\n4. Save changes\n\n**Resolving:**\n1. Click diagnosis\n2. Click 'Mark as Resolved'\n3.

Provide reason\n5. Permanently removed (logged in audit trail)\n\n**Problem List Best Practices:**\n\n**Keep it Current:**\n• Review at every visit\n• Resolve conditions that are inactive\n• Update status as conditions change\n• Remove duplicate entries\n\n**Be Specific:**\n• Use most specific ICD-10 code available\n• E11.65 (with hyperglycemia) vs E11.9 (unspecified)\n• Include laterality when relevant\n• Document stage/severity\n\n**Prioritize:**\n• List most significant problems first\n• Mark chronic conditions clearly\n• Identify primary diagnosis for visit\n\n**Link Everything:**\n• Link prescriptions to diagnoses\n• Link lab orders to diagnoses\n• Link procedures to diagnoses\n• Improves claims approval\n• Documents medical necessity\n\n**Common Diagnosis Scenarios:**\n\n**Multiple Related Diagnoses:**\n\nExample - Diabetes complications:\n• E11.9 - Type 2 Diabetes (primary)\n• E11.22 - Type 2 Diabetes with CKD (if kidney disease present)\n• E11.36 - Type 2 Diabetes with diabetic neuropathy\n• E11.319 - Type 2 Diabetes with diabetic retinopathy\n\nKeep all relevant codes active for comprehensive documentation.\n\n**Combination Codes:**\n\nSome conditions have single combined codes:\n• I10 - Essential Hypertension (use instead of separate codes)\n• J44.0 - COPD with acute lower respiratory infection (not COPD + pneumonia separately)\n\nUse combination code when available.\n\n**Diagnosis Hierarchy:**\n\nFor claims and documentation:\n1. Primary Diagnosis - Main reason for visit/service\n2. Secondary Diagnoses - Contributing factors\n3. Additional Diagnoses - Other relevant conditions\n\n**Quality Measures:**\n\nCertain diagnoses trigger quality reporting:\n• Diabetes → A1C testing required\n• Hypertension → BP control monitoring\n• COPD → Spirometry testing\n• Depression → PHQ-9 screening\n\nSystem flags these for compliance tracking.\n\n**Diagnosis Reports:**\n\n**Available Reports:**\n• Active Diagnoses by Patient\n• Diagnosis Frequency (most common)\n• Chronic Disease Registry\n• Quality Measure Compliance\n• Diagnosis by Provider\n• Missing Diagnosis Links (prescriptions without diagnosis)\n\n**Using Reports:**\n1. Go to Reports module\n2. Select 'Diagnosis Reports'\n3. Choose report type\n4. Set filters (date range, provider, diagnosis)\n5. Generate and export\n\n**ICD-10 Code Updates:**\n\n**Annual Updates:**\nOctober 1st each year:\n• New codes added\n• Some codes deleted\n• Descriptions modified\n• System auto-updates\n\n**When Code Changes:**\n• System notifies affected charts\n• Recommend updating to new code\n• Old code still visible in history\n• Update prospectively, not retrospectively\n\n**Best Practices:**\n• Use most specific code possible (5-6 characters)\n• Include laterality when applicable (right vs left)\n• Document stage/severity for cancers\n• Link all prescriptions to diagnoses\n• Keep problem list current and accurate\n• Resolve inactive problems\n• Use chronic designation appropriately\n• Review problem list at each visit\n• Verify diagnoses support procedures/tests ordered\n• Use combination codes when available\n• Don't use unspecified codes if more specific available\n• Document onset dates accurately\n• Include patient in problem list review\n• Use consistent terminology\n• Avoid outdated or obsolete codes",
